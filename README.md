##Project Overview

I choose part of East London map from https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for East London.

##What did I learn in this project?
I was able to:

Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity
Parsing and gather data from popular file formats such as json, xml, csv, html.
Process data from many files and very large files that can be cleaned with spreadsheet programs.
Learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using MongoDB.


##Why is this Important to my Career?

I learnt how to wrangle data using map sample.
Data wrangling is a task that data scientists can spend up to 50-80% of their time doing according to many practicing data analyst and data scientists.


##This reposetory contains:

1. Python scripts for different processes of this project.
2. Example of .osm file (4.2 MB) which I downloaded from https://www.openstreetmap.org. Whole data is 94.3 MB.
